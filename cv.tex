\section{interests}
To secure a role within a reputable organisation where I can apply my skills and experience in Electronics in a R\&D environment. There is nothing more satisfying than being able to see a product from its initial conceptual stages through to manufacturing.
The ideal role would also provide a challenging environment that allows both personal and professional growth and development.
